            <p>Freezer standby meals don’t get any better than this – burritos filled with Mexican Shredded Beef in a rich, thick sauce, and stuffed with Mexican Red Rice and cheese. SO GOOD! You will love this Shredded Beef Burritos recipe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 large extra soft flour tortillas </li>
                <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups shredded cheese</li>
                <li>3 to 4 cups Mexican Shredded Beef plus sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup finely chopped coriander / cilantro</li>
                <li>2 cups Mexican Red Rice</li>
                <li>400g/14oz can corn kernels</li>
                <li>400g/14oz can black beans</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Microwave half the tortillas very briefly to warm them up (15 seconds or so). This ensures they don't crack when you roll them.</li>
                <li>Place 1 tortilla on a workbench - cover the rest with a tea towel to keep them warm.</li>
                <li>Place cheese down the middle of the tortilla, then top with 1/3 cup of beef, some corn, beans, then 1/4 cup rice.</li>
                <li>Roll the burrito up. (Note 2) Wrap in foil to hold it together.</li>
                <li>If you are serving it immediately, heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the burritos for around 4 to 5 minutes on each side to make the tortilla brown and heat the inside through.</li>
                <li>If freezing, place in the freezer. To reheat, you can either bake from frozen (with foil on) at 350F/180C for about 40 to 45 minutes, or thaw and cook in the skillet per above. You could microwave it (remove the foil) but I like my burritos a bit crispy!</li>
